### <span>Hello: Metaverse</span> <p>NYU Shanghai, Fall 2021</p>
The aim of this course is to explore the relationship between the virtual self and environment and to assess both as a space for learning and collaboration. Every student gets their own mobile VR headset. The course takes place entirely in [the black sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash), a multi-user VR platform I've designed for the purpose of experimentation and collaboration. The course is built around 3 principles: 
 
1. Technology must mediate our senses: No in-person interaction is allowed.
2. An attraction to the avant-garde. Activities are experimental or unorthodox with respect to the current emerging media status quo: No Zoom. 
3. Activities must have, at their core, a goal of fostering experimentation and discovery of new modes of methods and practice in the field of emerging media and interaction: Each activity must center around instigating a prevailing assumption in the field.

I believe these principles will help to encourage exploration and discovery in the area of emerging media, philosophy and theories and practices of presence.

### <span>Application Lab</span> <p>NYU Shanghai, All Semesters</p>
appLab is an intensive project-driven course where students explore current challenges and opportunities at the intersections of emerging media and innovation through the lenses of `design`, `prototyping` and `innovation`. The course seeks to help students understand how these high-level concepts intersect with skills to form the basis for new applications of technology in society.

At the end of this course, students are able to think critically and holistically about not only what makes innovations possible but will also how to utilize emerging media technologies and ideas to bring innovations into the world that respect and acknowledge the values of design, iteration and innovation.

### <span>Practicum on Branding + Innovation</span> <p>NYU Shanghai, Every Spring</p>
Innovation is the process by which an organization generates creative new ideas and converts them into viable commercial products. Branding, on the other hand, is the process of creating a unique image for the product in the consumers‚Äô mind. This perception reflects on the organization as a whole. Moreover, branding aims to establish a differentiated presence in the marketplace to attract and retain loyal customers. Thus, innovation and branding are inextricably linked for organizational success, or survival, in today‚Äôs hyper-competitive business landscape.

This course aims to equip students with knowledge in both the innovation and branding processes. By participating in the [International L‚ÄôOreal Brandstorm Competition](https://brandstorm.loreal.com/en/challenges/landing), students will gain practical experience in formulating an idea, develop branding around said idea, and then pitching said idea (innovation and branding) in a competitive forum. Students will also develop an understanding of the role of design and innovation as a collaborative, multidisciplinary group activity; and improve writing and presentation skills. The course incorporates multiple ways of learning including: lectures, case studies, ethnographic research, industry expert feedback on projects and guest presentations, and design activities in the interactive media lab. In essence, the course integrates a project- based learning approach.

### <span>üçÑ1UP</span> <p>NYU Shanghai, Spring 2019</p>
Video games are the largest and perhaps most influential form of mass interactive media humans have ever created. They are also one of the most controversial. The video game has at time been seen as a villain, responsible for a violent society, the corruption of children or their eyesight while at the same time video games help educate millions and can positively reflect and impact the lives of billions of people and society at large.
 
This introductory course will focus on giving students an appreciation and understanding of video games in a historical and modern context, as a $100 billion dollar business and as a reflection of society and the power of interactive media to improve livelihoods. 

Students will play and make games of the past and present in order to understand how immersive interactive media can help create entirely new forms of compelling experiences and narratives. Throughout the course, students will become familiar with critical concepts such as iterative design, play testing, object-oriented programming, physically based rendering of light and sound, 3D modeling, logic and experience design. They will take a design-based approach to content creation, developing a proficiency in a variety of software tools, development methodologies and creation techniques. Students will work over 14 weeks in design teams to create interactive video games.

### <span>Superhuman</span> <p>NYU Abu Dhabi, January 2019</p>
We live today at the forefront of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Rapid progress and accessibility of disciplines and technologies such as programming, robotics, sensors, artificial intelligence and machine learning, nanotechnology, rapid prototyping and global communications networks are all building on and amplifying one another, making us superhuman. Smart systems - homes, factories, farms, grids or entire cities‚Äîwill help tackle problems as diverse as climate change and waste management to human health and happiness. Alongside these technological advances are a set of broader socio economic, geopolitical and demographic disruptions with nearly equivalent impact to the technological factors. This course seeks to foster a broad range of skills and an awareness of what those skills can impact through agile challenged-based projects and thoughtful reflection on their disruptions. 

Our living lab is provided by the course partner, one of the world's largest logstics companies, where small teams of students and mentors will design, develop and test technology-enhanced solutions to help realize human potential. Students will come away with a much better understanding of not just how to create interactive technology-enhanced prototypes and modern design practices, but also an appreciation for how to propose, enact and manage change across a multi-disciplinary and cultural modern organization.
