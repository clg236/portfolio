### <span>Hello: Metaverse</span> <span>Summer 2021</span>
A 1-bit VR platform for experimentation and metaverse preparation.
The black sun is meta-metaverse VR platform and an homage to Neal Stephenson's phenomenal sci-fi book Snow Crash . It's primary purpose is to allow for a new course I've designed, called Hello: Metaverse. Where students are given mobile VR headsets, and asked to create their own metaverses within the Black Sun.

## Past Projects
2020, Teaching Through Technical (Research: Education and Innovation)
Tembien, Ethiopia
The goal of this ongoing project is to create a technology-oriented sustainable high school in Tembien, Ethiopia.  We became aware of this need while working with the Dr. Atakalti school in January 2020.  This school, which teaches over 700 children in grades 1-8, was the field site for an NYU Abu Dhabi course: Resourcefulness.  The Dr. Atakalti school is considered a very good school by area parents who are eager for their children to attend. As a successful school, teachers are also eager to be employed there.  While at the school, however, we learned of their dire need for a companion high school which would allow their successful students to continue learning.  

2019, SkyNet (Research: Technology and Art)
NYU Shanghai
This project uses advanced motion capture technology and machine learning to recognize "expert and amateur motion" in a wide variety of disciplines, such as dance, calligraphy, and musical performance. 

2018, The Future Hardware Project (Research: Innovation)
Hax, Shenzhen, China
A short summer experience for a small number of students. The project consisted of research in the form of short articles on the Shenzhen ecosystem, research composed of ideation and creation of a product ostensibly for production in this ecosystem, and finally a ‘mapping’ exercise consisting of exploration and cataloging of Shenzhen’s Huaqiangbei electronics markets. 

2018, MMM (Exhibition)
Modern Museum of Art, Shanghai
Developed an exhibition demonstrating novel technologies and techniques to capture and reproduce photo-realistic environments in virtual reality.


2017, 超空 (Exhibition)
Global CRE8 Summit, Shenzhen
Designed and developed an innovative networked virtual reality experience where over 1,000 audience members were able to share and interact with each other in a virtual environment. 

2017, Project Neuron (Exhibition)
International Computer Music Conference, Shanghai
Developed software and systems to generate a multimedia visualization based on the neurological processes involved in hearing sound for the keynote performance at the 2017 ICMC Conference.

2017, HamletVR (Exhibition)
Tribeca Film Festival
HamletVR is an interactive virtual reality theater experience where participants at the Tribeca Film Festival and across the world could watch, interact with and explore Shakespeare from an entirely new point of immersion. 

2016, Bongos
Tech Open Air, Berlin
Bongos is a virtual reality audio production experiment where the user is able to create a multi-track virtual reality audio experience, where the sound from each track is accurately spatialized according to the location of objects relative to the listener.
