 This past Fall, China’s paramount leader Xi Jinping went on a [secretive trip to the province of Guangdong](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2169889/where-xi-jinping-officials-keep-tight-lid-guangdong-tour), China’s manufacturing breadbasket, where he hoped to boost confidence in his state-led economic model. Southern China is a linchpin in the global technology and consumer electronics supply chain, and one whose inhabitants rely heavily on connections with the rest of the world. They were also the first to experience the pains of the 2008 Financial Crisis - factories shut down overnight, workers were left unpaid, their bosses fleeing for Hong Kong and Taiwan. Ships were ordered to stay in port or to turn around and head back, fearful that financial institutions who had promised trade financing would go belly up. The governments of the United States and the EU unleashed a torrent of support for banks and non-bank financial institutions. China, with its closed financial system, had relatively little exposure to the global collateralized debt craze, but massive exposure to the global consumer confidence rebound that followed by means of its toy workshops, consumer electronics assembly lines, umbrella factories, auto parts manufacturers and chemical industries.

Instead of rescuing the banking sector, which is largely insulated from global debt markets, policymakers unleashed a US$600 billion stimulus targeted towards ensuring that the widespread unemployment manifesting itself in China’s low-wage manufacturing sector did not spread further and damage the economy or the losen the Party’s grip on power. Unable to arrest the drop in consumer demand from abroad and worried about social unrest, officials put local governments and state-owned firms to work - building the world longest bridges, most extensive high-speed train networks and entire cities.

During the financial crisis, China’s private sector was left to largely fend for itself as state firms and local governments feasted on the plentiful credit available to them from China’s large state banks. Corruption was rampant, and the opaque operating and ownership structure of state owned firms (SOEs) made it easy to appear to be following procurement and other rules while awarding large contracts to subsidiaries of subsidiaries partially owned by the cousin of a local government official. This bred a culture of favoritism and corruption within China’s SOEs and changed the behavior of their managers and leadership. No longer were the questions “who’s the best person for the job?” or “what decision will lead to the best outcome for the firm?” but instead, they were “who do I hire to ensure I stay in the good graces of the local party leader?” or “how can I benefit my own interests, or those of my close friends and family?” This was not only unproductive, but expensive. Today, Bloomberg estimates that Chinese state-owned firms and local governments are [responsible for almost $6 trillion dollars in debt](https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/chinas-debt-bomb). This spending spree in the early 2000s wasn’t just limited to local governments and SOEs, even the Chinese Ministry of Education and one of China’s top universities got in on the action by using shell corporations in Bermuda to buy the largest mall in the world in 2006. 

10 years later, as China celebrates the birthday of the reform and opening policies that sparked an incredible 40 years of growth and rising living standards, Southern China finds itself again in the path of competing global economic tsunamis -- largely rich, democratic, developed market economies demand further market-based reforms , and an increasingly powerful, cloistered and controlling Communist Party  demands unwavering support for state-led prerogatives and grand policies. 
 
40 years on, Southern China, especially the triad of Dongguan, Shenzhen and Zhuhai, is home to a majority of China’s private manufacturing base and its most promising high-tech firms. Apple’s iPhone assembler Foxconn, embattled networking equipment and mobile device firm Huawei, and BYD, a maker of electric vehicles compete and cooperate alongside producers of injection molds for the interiors of nearly every major car firm, industrial design houses with offices in hundreds of cities, and the thousands of other small and mid-sized firms that make up the world’s technology production line. Many of them were denied a lifeline from the state in 2008 and left for dead, passed over in favor of large state-owned construction firms and local government projects. Today, many are now China’s fastest-growing, best-managed and most productive firms.

These are the very firms that the government is now asking to help China move from a export driven to an innovation-led economy. The government has made available billions of dollars to those firms that can play by the rules set out in China’s ‘Made in China 2025’ plan, a ten-year-plan established in 2015 aimed at upgrading China’s low-wage manufacturing economy and reducing their reliance on foreign technology.

The plan’s aggressive timeline and goals are a central player in a well-documented [215 page report](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/Section%20301%20FINAL.PDF) detailing China’s various trade and regulatory practices by the Office of the United States Trade Representative this past March, the wellspring feeding much discussion and controversy among US and Chinese policy-makers. The Trump administration has generally reached the consensus that China is not “playing fair” in the game of liberal international trade -- its methods rely on sneaky hacks, state-sanctioned cyber-theft and forced technology transfers between foreign and Chinese firms.  The country regularly breaches WTO standards by setting overly high self-sufficiency targets and fails to fully disclose state subsidies to its technology companies, amongst hundreds of other well-documented transgressions.

China has recently made moves to suggest it is open to adding 10 years to the Made in China tagline and to removing some of the more onerous requirements that foreign firms hand over intellectual property and know-how to locals. It’s likely that China would have had to extend the plan’s milestones either way,  especially given the potential for technology firms such as Huawei to be cut off from the foreign-made microprocessors and software it relies upon to do business, at least for the time being. China 2025’s aggressive timeline is one of the major reasons we have seen such an increase in Chinese state-sponsored cyber-espionage, such as the recent Marriott hack, targeting US corporations and their executives. Another 10 years should give China’s hackers a bit of breathing room. 

According to China’s Ministry of Finance, profits for China’s 50 largest SOEs increased by 17% percent year on year to 2.8 trillion yuan (about 400 billion U.S. dollars) in the Jan-Oct period, all while reducing their financial leverage. Private firms, meanwhile, continue to struggle.

The irony of a correlation between increasing SOE profits and decreasing private-sector confidence is not lost on China’s paramount leader Xi Jinping, who recently voiced his unwavering support for China’s private sector, clearly worried that as economic growth slows, beleaguered private firms could be replaced or taken over by the state, reversing decades of reform and innovation and further pressuring policymakers to find alternative solutions to make up the loss in economic growth and productivity as a result of market-oriented private firms conforming to the inefficiencies of their state-owned parents. Before that can happen, China knows it must reform its SOEs. The burning question on the minds of Chinese leaders is: How to get the best of both worlds? How can we have state control with market-oriented bravado?

One likely strategy is positioning SOEs to benefit from private sector expertise. Modernizing SOEs requires gradual integration of new ideas, skills and sound management. This is better achieved by learning and adapting from private sector innovations rather than bureaucratic fiat. The government will likely shape private sector incentives to encourage more private industries to not only collaborate with SOEs, but also for more SOEs to take ownership stakes in private technology and scientific firms in order to ensure that the state maintains a strong grip on technology, communications and new scientific research without subjecting their management to antiquated systems of command and control. The assumption is that this mixed ownership model would give SOEs access to private sector expertise while providing private businesses with access to SOE resources - mainly funding and a fastlane through China’s vast and tangled regulatory environment. Weng Jieming, vice-chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the agency in charge of China’s centrally-owned SOEs summed this principle up by saying that "mixed ownership reform should be a two-way street.”

Another play available to policymakers is to inject technology and know-how directly into SOEs. In the past, China used a variety of subsidies and measures to entice Chinese expats from abroad to return to the motherland, laden with gifts of foreign information and expertise to help the country continue to modernize it’s industries. That era is now over. China’s private technology sector is full of the best and brightest tech minds and savviest businesspeople,  exactly the types the state needs to help overhaul their inefficient state-owned sector. 

This reform will ultimately hinge on the government’s ability to attract key talent away from China’s fast-growing private industries and the willingness of Chinese nationals who have been exposed to dynamic modern working environments to take up the life of a civil servant, complete with endless meetings, red stamps  and a 70% pay cut. Nevertheless, there may be a middle ground, one where the state is able to cajole successful firms into a relationship that benefits inefficient SOEs at the expense of a few star managers. Case in point, Jack Ma, following his abrupt retirement from Alibaba, was outed as a Party member — a shock to many who assumed his business was independent of political connections, but probably not a sound assumption given how the company has thrived in the Chinese market. Perhaps, as many assume, it’s time that the Party asks the top executives of China’s private sector to reciprocate and help SOEs modernize?

Practically, China’s leadership will likely decide, in the words of reformer Deng Xiaoping, to continue crossing the river by feeling the stones and take a gradualist and practical approach to evolving its SOEs. With China’s current debt issues and the political and social pressures to keep inefficient or insolvent SOEs alive, perhaps the idea of inviting foreign competition to accelerate the eventual phase-out of the bottom-most stragglers will not be so radical. In fact, it would be consistent with the country’s interests and the Party’s desires. It’s also the culturally acceptable solution - It’s the one way to rid of inefficient SOEs without the Party needing to admit their inefficiencies.
